# calculator
A calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Users are able to string together several operations after pressing '=' and get the right answer. 
For example: 12 + 7 = 19 - 5 = 14
Answers get rounded to 2 decimals.
Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator does nothing.
“clear” wipes out any existing data.
